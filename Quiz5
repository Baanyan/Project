hey guys/gal, Here is quiz4. Please, use the quiz4.html markup, styles.css and the empty scripts.js files to work on your quiz. 

Your code from quiz 3 should still work, you just need to make a few modification to it. 
That was the reason why I was stressing you guys/gal to use functions and function callbacks and all.
