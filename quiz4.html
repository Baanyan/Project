Now we know the DOM, lets start creating some dynamic markup to display the questions in our quiz.

1. use the markup provided and create 2 sections right after the closing header tag. First one with an id of question and the second with an id of feedback. We will use them to show the questions and provide feedback about whether the user has answered a question correctly or not.

2. Also add a paragragh tag in the header with an id of score to display the score as the game is being placed.

3. Now in the scripts.js file hook all of the elements you created to your js file.

4. Now create a function called update() to update the elements on the page. That function should take 3 parameters: First one is the element that is to be updated, the second parameter is for the content that it is to be updated with, the third one is an optional class that can be added to the content. If a class argument is not provided, the code should still work guys.

Now guys, I want you to check the element to see if the element already has a first child, if so, assigns it to the variable p, if it doesn't, then create a new paragragh element. the rest of the function should add the content provided in the argument and append it to the element and check to see if a class was provided and add it an attribute to the element.

5. Update your previous code to make it work with this update.

NOTE: I gave you guys some CSS to start with, 

Happy Coding guys!!!
