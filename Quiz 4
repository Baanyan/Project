 Use an object to store these info about the quiz:
 
 
Name —>Super Hero Name Quiz
Description —> How many super heroes can you name?
question —> What is the real name of
questions —> (question —> Superman, answer —> Clarke Kent), (question —> Batman, answer —> Bruce Wayne), (question —> Wonder Woman, answer —> Dianna Prince) )


What’s above is self explanatory guys. I wrote it in a way for you to understand what the requirements are. The questions property contains an array of object.
so this quiz is about changing your array to this object literal and make a few changes of how you’re getting the info from the object.


Happy coding guys...
